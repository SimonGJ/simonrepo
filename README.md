Afterpay.

(A history of disruption)

Background

Nick Molnar and Anthony Elson were neighbours. Nick had a flair for marketing and Anthony was the Chief Investment Officer for the Guinness Peat Group.
The spark for the investment was Molnar's view that "Millennials have a total aversion to credit [cards]", because they can lead to compounding interest.  (1)
In 2014 they opened a business where money was loaned but no interest paid. The company is funded by merchant payments and late fees from borrowers. It began as a start-up and was floated on the ASX in 2016 with a 25 million dollar IPO. Market penetration was achieved by a social media campaign requesting customers to approach their chief retailer asking for the facility. A viral response followed.

The Business

Historicly retailers encouraged people to spend in their bricks and mortar businesses using Christmas Club and layby. These all sound like words from another age. Confronted by internet shopping there was a massive gap in demand from shoppers who wished to buy and stagger their payments for things they could see and touch. No interest was a masterstroke. Credit cards have always been seen as a step to penury, banks always have been seen as hardnosed institutions regardless of marketing, and the space for an electronic technical solution was wide open. Pawn shops had the reputation of extortion, bank and non-bank lenders were no real competitors given the size of the finance wanted and the documentation required.

The target: Female Millennials 

Millennials are Australia's largest consumer segment and comprise 54% of the population. Female consumers form the majority of the consumer base These customers want a frictionless process. " This is a testament to the skill and
innovation of the team in bringing a new and inclusive financial product to life. It also signals our commitment to supporting and enhancing financial inclusion, particularly for younger women." (2)

  

The Context

Afterpay has flexibility that technology brings. As a result of mobile phones and the internet, its customers are its publicity team, accountants, credit researchers and source of funds. It enables its retailers to act as its sales agents in the interests of happier customers and increased turnover. The BNPL space is now occupied by numerous imitators without the branding of the first mover including Zip, Humm, Sezzle and Splitit.(3)

The Result.

The company went from a 2014 start up to Australia’s biggest takeover in November 2021 when it was taken over by Square for 39 billion dollars.

Recommendations.

The future is no doubt international. “Our global expansion is accelerating, with the U.S. and U.K. growing at a considerably faster rate than what we experienced in ANZ. The U.S. now represents over 30 percent of the group’s total underlying sales and has the largest number of customers actively using the platform.” (4) The tried and true method of utilising a customer base that wishes to avoid interest payments as social media warriors driving the company forward, supported by retail enterprises looking to expand the business.
